# Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection

# Introduction:

Anomaly detection is the process of discover the event or the points which are unexpected at 
this position of the dataset or deviates from the normal pattern of the dataset. 
So, the detection of those points very important; because it give us an early step to make the 
emergency movements to control that un usual change. 
We used many techniques to reach best one to apply it on our way of the project. 

# Dataset:
This dataset provides information about the telecommunication activity over the city of Milano. The dataset is the result of a computation over the Call Detail Records (CDRs) generated by the Telecom Italia cellular network over the city of Milano. CDRs log the user activity for billing purposes and network management.

# Anomaly Detection Methods: 
The outlairs and anomaly detection different methods:
 - 1- Tukey’s box plot method.
 - 2- Isolation forest.
 - 3- Anomaly Detection with LSTM Autoencoders.
 - 4- Seasonal-Trend Decomposition.

## 1- Tukey’s box plot method

in this method we depend on the pox plot to determine if the point is outlier or not and not 
only that it gives us the ability to decide if this outlier is possible or probable outlier point; by 
calculate the following parameters: 
- 25th percentile (Q1) 
- 75th percentile (Q3) 
- interquartile range (IQR = Q3 – Q1) 
- Lower inner fence: Q1 – (1.5 * IQR) 
- Upper inner fence: Q3 + (1.5 * IQR) 
- Lower outer fence: Q1 – (3 * IQR) 
- Upper outer fence: Q3 + (3 * IQR) 

Then decide if the point between the inner fence and outer fence it considered as a possible 
outlier point. And if the point lies outside the outer fence, it will be considered as probable 
outlier. 

## 2- Isolation forest.
In this method we will depend on the detection using some Machine Learning algorithms. In the 
we will depend on Isolation Forest. 

One of those algorithms is the Isolation Forest method. Isolation Forest build using the decision 
trees which depend on the points that go deeper into the tree are not anomalies and points 
which go short distance have big probability to be anomalies, and it is unsupervised learning 
model which used without labeled data. 

The algorithm goes by selecting a sample of the dataset then branch it on the binary tress by 
setting a threshold if the sample we selected is less than this threshold it will be in the left 
branch and if it not it will be in the right branch. This process repeated until we every point in 
the dataset is isolated. 

## 3- Anomaly Detection with LSTM Autoencoders.
