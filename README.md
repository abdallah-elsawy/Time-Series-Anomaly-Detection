# Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection

# Introduction:

Anomaly detection is the process of discover the event or the points which are unexpected at 
this position of the dataset or deviates from the normal pattern of the dataset. 
So, the detection of those points very important; because it give us an early step to make the 
emergency movements to control that un usual change. 
We used many techniques to reach best one to apply it on our way of the project. 

# Dataset:
 to detect anonymous in milan dataset from:

### Anomaly Detection Methods: 
- The outlairs and anomaly detection different methods:
 - 1- Tukeyâ€™s box plot method
 - 2- Isolation forest
 - 3- Anomaly Detection with LSTM Autoencoders
 - 4- Seasonal-Trend Decomposition
